# SurfingWheelchair
CONTEXT
The chosen context is the zoo, a public facility that maintains a collection of animals displayed to the public. It is a leisure space that often requires visitors to travel long distances walking to explore the establishment. The zoo will then offer a wheelchair service for visitors with walking difficulties. The wheelchairs will incorporate IoT to provide an enhanced, personalized experience that focuses on wellbeing. At the same time, they will offer the zoo and wheelchair providers with relevant data to improve the zoo’s design and the wheelchair service itself.

SENSORS

- N° 1 Beacon
(to get data about the location of the wheelchair)

> Most chosen route = users’ preferred routes
> Recommendations: 1. Road to choose - 2. Users’ preferences

- N° 1 BNO055 Intelligent 9-axis absolute orientation sensor 
(to get data about the acceleration and inclination of the wheelchair)

> Road surface inclination + road surface quality + wheelchair acceleration = road accessibility and condition
> Recommendations: 1. Road renovation - 2. Ideal route to chooose

- N° 1 BNO055 Intelligent 9-axis absolute orientation sensor
(to get data about the wheelchair’s acceleration)
[ S1. Being pushed; S3. Normal pushing; S3. Abnormal pushing]
- N° 4 Force Sensing Resistors (FSRs)
(to get data about the body position of the wheelchair’s user)
- N° 1 Heart rate sensor - Bluetooth Wristband
(to get data about the number of contractions (beats) of the heart per minute)

> Body position + heart rate frequency + wheelchair acceleration = degree of tiredness
> Recommendations: 1 when/where take a break - 2. Being driven/pushed to someone else
