# SurfingWheelchair
The chosen context is the zoo, a public facility that maintains a collection of animals displayed to the public. It is a leisure space that often requires visitors to travel long distances walking to explore the establishment. The zoo will then offer a wheelchair service for visitors with walking difficulties. The wheelchairs will incorporate IoT to provide an enhanced, personalized experience that focuses on wellbeing. At the same time, they will offer the zoo and wheelchair providers with relevant data to improve the zooâ€™s design and the wheelchair service itself.
